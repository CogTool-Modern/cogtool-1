Hello World!

CogTool is a powerful tool for design and UX, and yet it seems not very well known. So much effort, [research](https://cogtool.wordpress.com/publications/) and [code](https://github.com/cogtool/cogtool/network), have went into this app and given its current state you'd never know it! The capabilities offered by CogTool are, in my view, novel and worth preserving. I hope to the UX & HCI community will support this software by using it in their work and providing feedback. 

This new fork of CogTool is to foster the further development of CogTool. The canonical repo on which I have a few [unmerged pull requests](https://github.com/cogtool/cogtool/pulls/justingeeslin) seems to be /unmaintained/. I would like to see our work eventually merged in to Canonical CogTool, or CogTool Classic, but for now ,we’ll march forward with a CogTool version that is modern and as a _minimum_ supports the well-research functionality and as _secondarily_ fields new features and enhancements. 

At present, CogTool does not run on the latest 64-bit only operating systems. Our first goal is to modernize CogTool in this way. My second goal is to consolidate and modernize the documentation so that more people will learn about and use in the work CogTool. This work is ongoing and captured in [the GitHub issues of the recent CogTool fork, called CogTool-Modern](https://github.com/CogTool-Modern/cogtool/issues), for these main objectives. PRs welcome!
